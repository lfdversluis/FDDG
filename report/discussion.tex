\section{Discussion}
% (recommended size: 1 page): 

% Summarize the main findings of your work
% and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in the design of the DAS system. Should WantGame
% use a distributed system to implement the DAS system? Try to extrapolate from the
% results reported in Section 6.b for system workloads that are orders of magnitude
% higher than what you have tried in real-world experiments.

	As discussed earlier in section \ref{subsec:system_overview}, we decided to use a mirrored game design with multiple servers. 
	Since the field is small, storing the entire field doesn't require much bandwidth. 
	Moreover, since every server maintains the whole board a server crash can be easily overcome. 
	Once the crashed server recovers, one of the operational servers can send the entire field to that server. 
	Once the crashed server receives the field it can participate immediately again. 
	As result this also means that the current design is very fault tolerant. 
	Only if all servers crash simultaneously, the game will be unrecoverable.
	This offers WantGame a consistent and available system. 
	They lose some performance due to an increased amount of messages are sent due to actions being broadcast to all servers and clients.
	
	TODO results from 6b. (experiments).
