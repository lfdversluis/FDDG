\section{Discussion}
(recommended size: 1 page): 

Summarize the main findings of your work
and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in the design of the DAS system. Should WantGame
use a distributed system to implement the DAS system? Try to extrapolate from the
results reported in Section 6.b for system workloads that are orders of magnitude
higher than what you have tried in real-world experiments.
