\textbf{With an increasing popularity of online games, the resources required to deploy gaming services are raising. Motivated by the shortcomings of a centralized system, a distributed architecture of the Fault Tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG) is presented. The system is highly fault tolerant by the use of a mirrored game architecture. Consistency is guaranteed by letting all servers acknowledge the actions of  players. Experiments have been conducted to analyze the consistency, fault tolerance and performance of the game. It can be concluded that the requirements imposed by WantGame BV are successfully satisfied.}
