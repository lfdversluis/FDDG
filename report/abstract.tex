\textbf{With an increasing popularity of online games, the resources required to deploy gaming services are rising.
	Motivated by the shortcomings of a centralized system, a distributed architecture of the Fault-Tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG) is presented. 
	Two requirements of the system are fault tolerance against failing nodes and consistency between the servers.
	The system is highly fault-tolerant by the use of a mirrored game architecture. 
	Consistency is guaranteed by letting all servers acknowledge the requests for actions of players. 
	Finally, to analyze the consistency, fault tolerance and performance of the game, experiments have been conducted. 
	It can be concluded that the requirements imposed by WantGame BV are successfully satisfied.}
