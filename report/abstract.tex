\textbf{With an increasing popularity of online games, the demand for resources required to deploy gaming services goes up.
	Motivated by the shortcomings of a centralized system, a distributed architecture of the Fault-Tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG) has been built on request for WantGame BV. 
	The design of the game focuses on fault-tolerance and consistency.
	Fault-tolerance is achieved by making use of a mirrored game architecture. 
	Consistency is guaranteed by letting all servers acknowledge the requests for actions of players. 
	Through experiments the requirements are measured and the limits and tradeoffs discussed.
	From these experiments it can be concluded that the requirements imposed by WantGame BV are successfully satisfied.}
