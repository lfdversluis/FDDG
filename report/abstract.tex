\textbf{With an increasing popularity of online games, the demand for resources required to deploy gaming services is rising.
	Motivated by the shortcomings of a centralized system, a distributed architecture of the Fault-tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG) is developed on request for WantGame BV. 
	The design of the game focuses on fault tolerance and consistency.
	The system achieves fault tolerances by making use of a mirrored game architecture and consistency is guaranteed by letting all servers acknowledge the requests for actions of players. 
	Experiments are conducted to measure the performance of the system.
	From these experiments the conclusion can be made that the requirements imposed by WantGame BV are met by the chosen design.}
