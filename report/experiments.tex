\section{Experimental Results}
(recommended size: 1.5 pages)

\subsection{Experimental setup}
Describe the working environments (DAS-4, Amazon EC2,
etc.), the general workload and monitoring tools and libraries, other tools and
libraries you have used to implement and deploy your system, other tools and
libraries used to conduct your experiments.

\subsection{Experiments}
Describe the experiments you have conducted to analyze each
system feature, such as consistency, scalability, fault-tolerance, and
performance. Analyze the results obtained for each system feature. Use one
sub-section per experiment (or feature). In the analysis, also report:
i. Service metrics of the experiment, such as runtime and response time of
the service, etc.
ii. (optional) Usage metrics and costs of the experiment.
