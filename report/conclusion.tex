\section{Conclusion}
In this report, the design of the Fault-Tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG) is presented. First, we discussed the design of the game, presented the general structure of the system and explain what happens when clients or server crashes to ensure fault tolerance. To ensure consistency, a mirrored game architecture where the game state is replicated over all servers has been implemented. After the game architecture has been discussed, our experiments we have conducted with our game are elaborated. The focus is on experiments with consistency, fault-tolerance, scalability and message complexity of the game.\\
TODO: hier moet nog een stukje komen a.d.h.v. de discussions, wat zijn de belangrijkste conclusies die we kunnen trekken uit ons design?
