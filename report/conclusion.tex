\section{Conclusion}
In this report, the design of the Fault-Tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG) is presented. First, the design of the game and the general structure of the system are explained. Next, the mechanisms that handle clients or server crashes to ensure fault tolerance, were discussed. To ensure consistency, a mirrored game architecture where the game state is replicated over all servers has been implemented. Furthermore, experiments that have conducted, along with their results, are described. The focus is of the experiments lie on consistency, fault-tolerance, scalability and message complexity of the game. Finally the tradeoffs and drawbacks of the design are discussed.\\
The conclusion of this report is that WantGame should use a distributed system as defined in this report, since it meets all of their requirements on fault-tolerance, scalability and consistency.
