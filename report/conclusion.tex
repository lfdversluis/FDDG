\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we presented the design of the Fault-Tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG). First, we discussed the design of the game, presented the general structure of the system and explain what happens when clients or server crashes to ensure fault tolerance. To ensure consistency, we've chosen for a mirrored game architecture where the game state is replicated over all servers. After the game architecture has been discussed, we present our experiments we have conducted with our game. We focused on experiments with consistency, fault-tolerance, scalability and message complexity of the game.\\
TODO: hier moet nog een stukje komen a.d.h.v. de discussions, wat zijn de belangrijkste conclusies die we kunnen trekken uit ons design?
