\section{Conclusion}
In this report, the design of the Fault-tolerant Distributed Dragon Game (FDDG) is presented. 
First, the design of the game and the general structure of the system are explained. 
Next, the mechanisms that handle clients or server crashes to ensure fault tolerance, are discussed. 
To ensure consistency, a mirrored game architecture where the game state is replicated over all servers has been implemented. 
Furthermore, experiments that have conducted, along with their results, are described. 
The focus of the experiments is on consistency, fault tolerance, scalability and message complexity of the game. 
Finally the tradeoffs and drawbacks of the design are discussed.\\
After performing the experiments, we can conclude that consistency is guaranteed amongst the servers. 
The game is fault tolerant and can handle crashing servers and clients at any point during the game, making the system able to withstand multiple crashing servers at the same time. 
While the number of messages in the system is high, the performance is still acceptable for a MMORPG. 
Finally, the load is evenly divided over all servers by clients connecting random to one of the available servers.
The conclusion of this report is that WantGame should use a distributed system as defined in this report, since it meets all of their requirements on fault tolerance, scalability and consistency.
